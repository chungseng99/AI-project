## B. ABSTRACT

Early childhood education is the period of time from a child's birth to when they enter kindergarten.
It is an inportant time in children's live because it is when they first learn how to interact with other and 
also begin to develop interests that will stay with them through their whole lives. Learning and mental development 
begin immedietely after birth. Therefore, children greatly benefit by receiving education before kindergarten.

Since kindergarten begins around the ages of 5 to 6 for most children, after major brain development occurs, parents
should begin to educating children at younger ages. Many parents begin to educate their children during these important 
developmental years by teaching them the alphabets which is the fundamental of a language. Initiation of teaching children to 
acquire some fundamental knowledges could take a lot of times. Due to time constraints such as long schedules of work, many parents 
send their children to child's care centre to be taken care and also learn to recognise alphabet or even words as their early childhood
education. Unfortunately, the widespread of covid-19 disease has caused the lockdown of the country which leads to a situation where the child's care centre are not allowed to operate. Even though the parents have to work from home but they do not have time to teach their children.

In this project, we will be providing an interface where the user can learn to write and recognise alphabets. This project is suitable for 
the children under process of learning alphabets as it is easy to use. The user only have to click on an audio button then it will read out the alphabet to be written, after the user have wrote the alphabet click "Check Answer" to verify what they have written by using machine learning.
